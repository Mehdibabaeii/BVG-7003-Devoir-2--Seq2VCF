# General Paths
# Specify the root directory containing input data files (FASTQ) here.
DATA_DIR="/path/to/your/data/"  # Example: "/project/my_data/"

# Path to the barcodes file used for demultiplexing.
BARCODES_FILE="/path/to/your/barcodes_file.txt"  # Example: "/project/my_data/barcodes.txt"

# Path to the reference genome FASTA file (ensure it is indexed with BWA and SAMtools).
REF_GENOME="/path/to/your/reference_genome.fa"  # Example: "/project/genomes/reference.fa"

# Directory where all pipeline results will be stored.
RESULTS_DIR="/path/to/results/"  # Example: "/project/my_output/"

# Quality Control Parameters
# Adapter sequence used for trimming.
ADAPTER_SEQ="AGATCGGAAGAGCGGG"  # Default Illumina adapter sequence.

# Minimum read length to retain after trimming.
MIN_LENGTH=50  # Reads shorter than this will be discarded.

# Variant Calling Filters
# Minimum Phred quality score for variant calls.
QUAL_THRESHOLD=20  # Variants below this quality will be filtered out.

# Minimum read depth required for a variant call.
DEPTH_THRESHOLD=10  # Variants supported by fewer reads will be excluded.

# Maximum allowed proportion of missing data across samples.
MAX_MISSING=0.2  # Variants with missing data in >20% of samples will be filtered.

# Minimum minor allele frequency (MAF) required to retain a variant.
MAF_THRESHOLD=0.01  # Variants with MAF below 1% will be excluded.

# Notes:
# 1. Update the paths to reflect your data and environment.
# 2. Ensure all input files (FASTQ, barcodes, reference genome) are correctly formatted and accessible.
# 3. If running on a cluster, verify that directories have proper permissions for the pipeline to write results.
# 4. Adjust filtering thresholds to suit the goals and stringency of your analysis.
