# -------------------------
# General Paths
# -------------------------
# Specify the root directory containing input data files (FASTQ) here.
DATA_DIR="./data/"  # Example: "./data/"
BARCODES_FILE="./barcodes/barcodes_file.txt"  # Path to the barcodes file used for demultiplexing
REF_GENOME="./refgenome/reference_genome.fa"  # Path to the reference genome FASTA file (ensure it is indexed with BWA and SAMtools)

# -------------------------
# Quality Control Parameters
# -------------------------
# Adapter sequence used for trimming.
ADAPTER_SEQ="AGATCGGAAGAGCGGG"  # Default Illumina adapter sequence

# Minimum read length to retain after trimming.
MIN_LENGTH=50  # Reads shorter than this will be discarded

# Perform Quality Control after trimming (optional)
QC_AFTER_TRIM=true  # Set to true to run FastQC on trimmed reads

# -------------------------
# Variant Calling Filters
# -------------------------
# Minimum Phred quality score for variant calls.
QUAL_THRESHOLD=20  # Variants below this quality will be filtered out

# Minimum read depth required for a variant call.
DEPTH_THRESHOLD=10  # Variants supported by fewer reads will be excluded

# Maximum allowed proportion of missing data across samples.
MAX_MISSING=0.2  # Variants with missing data in >20% of samples will be filtered

# Minimum minor allele frequency (MAF) required to retain a variant.
MAF_THRESHOLD=0.01  # Variants with MAF below 1% will be excluded

# -------------------------
# Parallelization and Resources
# -------------------------
# Number of threads to use for parallel tasks (trimming, alignment, etc.)
THREADS=8  # Adjust according to available cores for parallelization

# SLURM resources for job scheduling (if running on a cluster)
SBATCH_TIME="02:00:00"  # Maximum duration of each SLURM job (HH:MM:SS)
SBATCH_MEM="16G"  # Memory allocated per job (can be adjusted depending on the dataset size)

# -------------------------
# Log Management
# -------------------------
# Maximum age for logs in days
MAX_LOG_AGE=7  # Keep logs from the last 7 days. Adjust as needed

# -------------------------
# Optional SnpEff Annotation Parameters
# -------------------------
# The user does not need to specify the SnpEff database here, as it will be determined automatically based on REF_GENOME
# The database will be derived from the REF_GENOME file name (e.g., rice, maize, arabidopsis, etc.)
SNP_EFFECT_DB=""  # This will be determined dynamically based on REF_GENOME in the script
