# Seq2VCF Pipeline

The **Seq2VCF Pipeline** is a robust bioinformatics tool designed to process raw sequencing data and generate high-quality Variant Call Format (VCF) files. This pipeline streamlines genomic analysis through automated steps such as demultiplexing, quality control, alignment, variant calling, and functional annotation.

## Purpose and Functionality

The pipeline was developed to handle genotyping-by-sequencing (GBS) data efficiently, enabling users to identify genetic variants in a streamlined and reproducible manner. It provides flexibility to adapt to various experimental setups by allowing configuration through parameter files. Key features include:  
- Automated processing from raw reads to annotated variants.  
- Support for multiple input samples via barcode demultiplexing.  
- Comprehensive quality control and error handling.

## Input and Output File Formats

### Input File Formats:
- **Raw Sequencing Data**: Compressed FASTQ files (`.fq.gz`) containing sequencing reads.  
- **Barcode File**: Tab-separated text file with sample barcodes (`barcodes.txt`).  
- **Reference Genome**: FASTA format file (`.fa`) with the genome sequence.  

### Output File Formats:
- **Demultiplexed Reads**: FASTQ files (`.fq.gz`) for individual samples.  
- **Quality Reports**: HTML and text reports from FastQC.  
- **Aligned Reads**: BAM files (`.bam`) for each sample.  
- **Variants**: VCF files (`.vcf`) with detected and filtered variants.  
- **Annotated Variants**: Annotated VCF files (`.annotated.vcf`) with functional information (if enabled).

## Dependencies and Installation Steps

### Software Requirements:
The pipeline requires the following tools:
- **Python** (v3.5+)
- **Java** (v22.0.2+)
- **Cutadapt** (v2.1+)
- **Sabre** (v1.000+)
- **BWA** (v0.7.17+)
- **SAMtools** (v1.8+)
- **BCFtools** (v1.15+)
- **FastQC** (v0.11.2+)
- **SnpEff** (v5.2e)

### Installation Steps:
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/username/Seq2VCF.git
   cd Seq2VCF
   ```
2. if necessary, install required tools.  Use conda, apt, or brew based on your system. Example for conda:
     ```bash
   conda install -c bioconda bwa samtools bcftools fastqc cutadapt
   ```
3. Ensure the tools are accessible in your PATH by adding them to your .bashrc or .zshrc.

## How to Run the Pipeline
### Configuration:
Edit the **parameters.conf** file to specify input paths, output directories, and processing options. Key parameters include:

**DATA_DIR**: Path to the raw data folder.
**BARCODES_FILE**: Path to the barcode file.
**REF_GENOME**: Path to the reference genome file.
**RESULTS_DIR**: Directory for saving results.
**RUN_ANNOTATION**: Enable functional annotation (true/false).
### Execution:
Run the pipeline using the main script:
```bash
Copy the code
sbatch pipeline.sh
```

## Log File Details and Troubleshooting
The pipeline generates a log file (pipeline.log) for tracking progress and debugging.

### Log File Contents:
**INFO**: Normal operation messages.
**WARN**: Non-critical issues that may need attention.
**ERROR**: Critical errors that terminate the pipeline.
### Troubleshooting:
**Missing Dependencies**: Ensure all tools are installed and accessible in the PATH.
**File Not Found**: Check the parameters.conf file for correct paths.
**Annotation Errors**: If SnpEff fails, ensure the correct genome database is downloaded and specified in parameters.conf.
**Out of Memory**: Allocate sufficient memory to Java-based tools (e.g., SnpEff). Edit JAVA_OPTS in parameters.conf if needed.
