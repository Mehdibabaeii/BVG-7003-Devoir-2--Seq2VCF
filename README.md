# Seq2VCF Pipeline
This repository provides a comprehensive bioinformatics pipeline for processing raw sequencing data and generating high-quality Variant Call Format (VCF) files. The pipeline is specifically suited for genotyping-by-sequencing (GBS) data and automates multiple steps required in genomic analyses, including quality control, trimming, alignment, and variant calling.

## Pipeline Overview

The pipeline automates the following steps:

1. **Demultiplexing**: Splits sequencing reads based on barcode sequences to assign them to the correct samples.
2. **Quality Control (QC)**: Evaluate the quality of sequencing data using FastQC to ensure it meets the required standards.
3. **Adapter Trimming**: Removes adapter sequences and short reads to ensure high-quality data for downstream analysis.
4. **Alignment**: Maps reads to a reference genome using BWA for variant discovery.
5. **Variant Calling**: Detects and filters genetic variants based on several user-defined thresholds.

Each step is parameterized for reproducibility and includes error-handling mechanisms to ensure robustness during execution.

## System Requirements

The pipeline requires the following software dependencies. Please ensure these tools are installed and available:

- **Python** (v3.5+)
- **Java** (OpenJDK 1.8.0_102+)
- **Cutadapt** (v2.1+)
- **Sabre** (v1.000+)
- **BWA** (v0.7.17+)
- **SAMtools** (v1.8+)
- **BCFtools** (v1.15+)
- **FastQC** (v0.11.2+)
- **SnpEff** (v5.2e) - for optional variant annotation

These dependencies can be loaded using your system's environment manager, such as `module load`.

## Directory Structure

Organize your input files as follows to ensure the pipeline functions correctly:

```bash
/project/
  ├── data/
  │   ├── raw_data.fq.gz      # Raw sequencing reads in FASTQ format
  │   ├── barcodes.txt        # Barcode file for demultiplexing (tab-separated)
  ├── refgenome/
  │   ├── reference.fa        # Reference genome in FASTA format
  ├── results/                # Directory for pipeline outputs
```

### Input Files

- **Raw Sequencing Data**: Sequencing reads in `.fq.gz` format, located in `/data`.
- **Barcodes File**: A tab-separated file containing barcode sequences and associated sample names, located in `/data/barcodes.txt`.
- **Reference Genome**: FASTA format reference genome located in `/refgenome/`, which should be indexed using `bwa index` and `samtools faidx`.

## Configuration Parameters

The parameters are specified in the `parameters.conf` file. Key parameters include:

- **ADAPTER_SEQ**: The adapter sequence to trim from reads.
- **MIN_LENGTH**: The minimum length of reads to retain after adapter trimming.

### Variant Calling Thresholds

- **QUAL_THRESHOLD**: The minimum variant quality score.
- **DEPTH_THRESHOLD**: The minimum depth (coverage) required for a variant.
- **MAX_MISSING**: The maximum fraction of missing data allowed for each variant.
- **MAF_THRESHOLD**: The minimum minor allele frequency for variant inclusion.

## Output Directory Structure

Pipeline results are stored in the `results/` directory, organized as follows:

```bash
/results/
  ├── demultiplexed/          # Demultiplexed reads for each sample
  ├── qc_reports/             # Quality control reports generated by FastQC
  ├── trimmed/                # Trimmed reads after adapter removal
  ├── alignment/              # Aligned BAM files
  ├── variants/               # Filtered VCF files
```

## Pipeline Steps

### Step 1: Demultiplexing

**Tool Used**: Sabre

**Command**:

```bash
sabre se -f *.fq.gz -b ${BARCODES_FILE} -u ${DEMUX_DIR}/unmatched.fq.gz > ${DEMUX_DIR}/demux.log 2>&1
```

**Description**: Demultiplexes the raw sequencing data based on the barcode file, splitting the reads into sample-specific files. Any unmatched reads are stored in the `unmatched.fq.gz` file.

**Output**: Demultiplexed reads for each sample are stored in `results/demultiplexed/`. Log files are saved in `results/demultiplexed/demux.log`.

### Step 2: Quality Control

**Tool Used**: FastQC

**Command**:

```bash
fastqc -t 10 -o ${QC_DIR} ${DATA_DIR}/*.fq
```

**Description**: FastQC runs quality control on the raw sequencing data, generating reports that include metrics such as sequence quality scores and adapter content.

**Output**: QC reports are saved in `results/qc_reports/`.

### Step 3: Adapter Trimming

**Tool Used**: Cutadapt

**Command**:

```bash
cutadapt -a ${ADAPTER_SEQ} -m ${MIN_LENGTH} -o ${TRIM_DIR}/${base}_trimmed.fq.gz "$fq"
```

**Description**: Cutadapt trims adapter sequences from the reads, ensuring that only high-quality sequences are retained. The minimum length of the reads after trimming is controlled by `MIN_LENGTH`.

**Output**: Trimmed reads are saved in `results/trimmed/`.

### Step 4: Alignment

**Tool Used**: BWA

**Command**:

```bash
bwa mem -t 10 ${REF_GENOME} "$fq" > ${ALIGN_DIR}/${base}.sam
```

**Description**: Aligns the trimmed reads to the reference genome using BWA. After alignment, SAM files are converted to BAM format, sorted, and indexed using SAMtools.

**Output**: Aligned BAM files are stored in `results/alignment/`.

### Step 5: Variant Calling with Filters

**Tool Used**: SAMtools and BCFtools

**Command**:

```bash
samtools mpileup -g -f ${REF_GENOME} -b ${VCF_DIR}/bam_list.txt | \
bcftools call -mv -Ov -o ${VCF_DIR}/variants_raw.vcf
```

**Description**: SAMtools generates the pileup file from the aligned BAM files, and BCFtools is used to call variants. Filters are applied to remove low-quality variants, based on the user-defined thresholds in `parameters.conf`.

**Output**: The filtered and sorted VCF file is stored in `results/variants/`.

### Step 6: Variant Annotation (Optional)

**Tool Used**: SnpEff

**Command**:

```bash
java -Xmx4g -jar snpEff.jar annotate -v ${SNP_EFFECT_DB} ${VCF_DIR}/variants_sorted.vcf.gz > ${VCF_DIR}/variants_annotated.vcf
```

**Description**: SnpEff annotates the variants with functional information, such as gene names and the potential impact of mutations.

**Output**: The annotated VCF file is stored in `results/variants/`.

## Error Handling

The pipeline includes robust error-handling mechanisms at each stage to ensure smooth execution. If any command fails, the pipeline stops and displays an error message, directing users to the log files for more information.

## Customization

You can adjust various parameters for each step by modifying the values in the `parameters.conf` file. The most commonly adjusted parameters include adapter sequences, minimum read length, and variant calling thresholds.
